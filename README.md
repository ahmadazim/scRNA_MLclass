# Implementing a machine learning approach to scRNA-seq classification
A machine learning model was developed to classify cell types based solely on plastid gene expression profiles. This work is part of a larger research study: Using Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data to Study Plastid Differentiation Dynamics with Nucleus-Encoded Gene Expression in *Arabidopsis thaliana*.
